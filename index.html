                <p>
                   Hi! My name is Jordan and I am a first-year graduate student at the University of Michigan. 
                   I am studying information science with a focus on human-computer interaction.
                   My name is Jordan Dodson and. I received my undergraduate degree in Information Science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. At my previous job, I worked as a UX Research Coordinator at Infosys on-site at Google. There, I recruited participants for Google Suite and Google Education UX studies. Prior to that, I worked as a Data Engineering Intern at Capital One and an IT Productivity Services Intern at Red Hat.
                <br>
                <br>
                   In the past, I have used app prototyping software like proto.io and photoshop to create low and high fidelity prototypes of different mobile applications. Skill-wise, I have a strong background in the research side of interaction design, with 3 academic information science publications and experience with usability testing and user interviews. Design-wise, I also have experience with paper prototyping and wireframing. The causes I care the most about are fighting for justice for the Black community, ensuring food security in low-income communities, and securing equal rights for the LGBTQ community. My philosophy for design is that the users come first. Interfaces should be designed with the user in mind and the different motivations and personas of the audience that the interface is created for should be heavily considered. Designers and researchers need to take into account their own biases and allow the users’ stories to be represented in their work.
                <br>
                <br>
                   Currently, I use Google Keep and Notion.so for my notetaking and organization. I use Habitica and My Study Life for task management and Google Calendar to manage all of my classes, office hours, and other events in my life. I love these applications because of their easy-to-use interfaces and the fact that they all sync between my devices. I use apps like Habitica over other task management apps because it gamifies my tasks (I receive points and “level-up” when I complete tasks or good habits) and makes checking things off of my to-do list actually fun! I like using any Google products over other company’s products because they are simple to use and work best with my Google Pixel phone.

                    I am also interested in food security on local, national, and international levels. I work with various organizations (Food Recovery Network, Nourish, Stop Hunger Now) to ensure that people of all walks of life have access to healthy, nutritious food. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A large part of my life has revolved around advocating for marginalized groups (specifically ethnic minorities, the LGBTQ community, the disabled community, and the low-income community). I have been involved in numerous organizations to ensure that people from all walks of life have access to food and are able to obtain a basic technological skillset.
